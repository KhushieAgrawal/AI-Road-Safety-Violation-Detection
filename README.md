# AI-Powered Road Safety Violation Detection System

## Overview

An AI-powered surveillance system designed to automatically detect road safety violations in campus environments. The system combines Computer Vision, Deep Learning, OCR, IoT, and Cloud Computing to identify helmet and seatbelt violations, extract vehicle license plate information, and maintain automated violation records.

The solution aims to reduce manual monitoring efforts while promoting safer road practices through intelligent and scalable traffic surveillance.

## Problem Statement

Monitoring road safety violations manually is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and prone to human error. Educational campuses and private premises often lack automated systems to detect violations such as riding without helmets or driving without seatbelts.

This project aims to provide an AI-driven solution that automates violation detection, license plate recognition, and record maintenance in real time.

## Methodology

### 1. Vehicle Detection

* Images are captured using a Raspberry Pi camera.
* A pre-trained YOLOv8 COCO model detects vehicles.

### 2. Violation Detection

* Helmet detection model checks compliance for two-wheelers.
* Seatbelt detection model checks compliance for four-wheelers.

### 3. License Plate Recognition

* License plate detection model localizes the number plate.
* EasyOCR extracts the plate text.

### 4. Violation Logging

* Detected violations are automatically logged to Google Sheets with timestamp, vehicle type, violation type, and plate number.
